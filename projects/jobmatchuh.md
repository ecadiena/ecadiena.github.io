# Job Match UH
The Job Match UH web application provides a new way for local and non-local companies who want to recruit students from UH to make their (potential) opportunities known to students. At the same time, students can create profiles on the site with their interests, experiences, and more. The site can match students to potential employers and vice-versa. 

### Project Basics
The following items were what the group generally agreed upon creating for the website
<li>
    <ul>Company Profile Page: containing company information</ul>
    <ul>Student Profile Page: containing student information</ul>
    <ul>Sign In: allows existing users to sign into their accounts</ul>
    <ul>Job Posting: form for companies to add jobs to their profile page, for students to view</ul>
    <ul>Administrator Page: admin users to view and delete student or company profiles</ul>
</li>

## Responsibilities
This project used a style of Agile Project Management called Issue Driven Project Management. My team and I tackled this project by creating sets of issues based on tasks that needed to be done for the web application to slowly gain more and more functionality, features, and more. "Milestones" were like checkpoints or deadlines that required my team and I to have a working version of the application live and available for other peers as well as our instructors to view our progress. As we begin each "Milestone" with a set of issues, new issues began arising as the project progressed. So my personal responsibilities varied as each member of the group picked up new issues once they were finished with their current one. 

## Learns
Throughout the course of this project I was able to exercise my knowledge of React, HTML, CSS, and most importantly Project Management. Without a hierarchy system, all group members had to agree upon everything, including: adding new issues to the "Milestone" Project, changing the user interface of the site, adding new features or functionality, etc. Some creative troubleshooting that I learned for the UI of certain things on the webpage was using the "Styles" section in the "Inspect" feature on Google Chrome. Here I was able to play around with the styling and positioning of things without having to switch back and forth from the IDE or having to worry about committing to my changes if I wasn't sure. I also became proficient in creating forms and handling the backend development for all of the databases we needed to use in the application. Examples of this are: adding new users to the database, adding data to said users based on if they are a student or a company, ability to edit or delete existing data that belongs to a user, and the ability to delete a user from the database entirely. Ultimately, I learned the importance of teamwork, communication, and efficiency.
