# Broadband for Hawai`i

Broadband for Hawaiʻi is an interactive accessible online platform that allows people to learn more about the internet. It is a website that allows users to get engaged with different classes that tackles different topics about the internet and why people of Hawaii should get broadband.

## A Brief Overview

Broadband for Hawaiʻi is split into 3 main roles: General Public, User, and Admin. 
- The general public has access to some class components such as viewing sessions, events, and lessons that allows them to view the classes without logging in. They are also able to view more information through the list of resources on the site.
- The user role can register for classes and sessions, create a personal profile, and accumulate points. They are enabled to view lessons and then test their knowledge by taking quizzes that provide feedback when completed. Logged in users are motivated with a point system. They can gain points by taking quizzes and answering problems correctly.
- The admin role is in charge of creating classes, quizzes, and sessions. They provide all of the resources and information for these that the users can then access. Admins have access to data analytics collected from the user’s profile data and survey data.

## Learns and Reponsibilities

Our team learned how to meet our client’s requirements and quickly adapt to changes needed to be done in a short amount of time. This challenge taught us about our own strengths and weaknesses as developers which helped us get through this HACC. Another important lesson we learned was that it is very important to understand the problem, and what needs to be done. Being organized and having a plan on what features need to be done on what day, is something very important for the team.

I was one of the front end developers, in charge of the look and feel of the application. Paying close attention to the user experience as it is expected to engage the user and encourage learning. My primary reponsibilities include: the design of the sign in / sign up page, the functionality of the quickstart feature, researching ADA compliant additions to our images and icons, and many more. 

## Results

In this hackathon my team placed 3rd overall in the Custom Coded Solution Division, as well as earning the People's Choice Award.
