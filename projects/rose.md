# Team RoSE
The RoSE Vertically Integrated Project(VIP) team aims to explore and learn about our universe through and beside intelligent robotic systems. VIP Team RoSE is concerned with the fabrication, dynamics, controls, systems engineering, and machine learning for space applications. 

## Responsibilities
Among the software subteam in Team RoSE, I was a frontend developer on the GNC team. The Guidance, Navigation, and Controls (GNC) team was resonsible for an interactive web application that can remotely control the rover as well as access it's status and live tracking feeds. As a frontend developer I was tasked with designing a user interface for the controls dashboard that a user can either use a wired joystick controller or the keyboard to control the movements of the rover. The Graphical User Interface was used by all subteams in Team RoSE including a cross functional team of mechanical and electrical engineers that needed a simple and easy to use app.
