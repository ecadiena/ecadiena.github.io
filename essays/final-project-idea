# Final Project : School Events Hub

## Overview  
A centralized information hub specifically for UH events with a readable interface to find upcoming events and maybe even filter them by interests/type/topic of events upcoming. We can throw in a social aspect to give students a platform to connect/socialize at an event.

## The problem
There are amazing events out there, but no one knows about them. We receive emails but how often do these students read the emails? We have an Instagram page, but how many students are they reaching? We could create a centralized place for all sorts of events tailored specifically to UH students.

## The solution
School Events Hub will provide information on upcoming events filtered by tags of different interests/topics. Include the opening gate as well as the closing gate. 

## Aproach
<ul>
  <li>Landing Page</li>
    Overview of the website.
  <li>User Home Page</li>
    Login with the UH email.
    Input interests, major, etc.
  <li>Upcoming Events</li>
    Display upcoming events.
  <li>Admin Home Page</li>
    Where, When, Type of Event
    Availability
    Amount of students interested
    Location address
</ul>

## Case Ideas
<ol>
  <li>Rad Grad</li>
  <li>Superfans for UH Athletic (phone app for upcoming UH sporting events)</li>
  <li>Unidays (Categories)</li>
</ol>

## Special Sauce
Collect poll data on how many people are planning to attend an event. Helps event coordinators get a headcount for an event and students to gauge interests by other people and find people who have similar interests. For some events that are limited slots only, there could be a feature to live count when the slots for RSVP are filled. Oftentimes they email it to us, but depending on the time we open the email, we donâ€™t know how many people have signed up or how many slots are left. 
<ul>
  <li>Add events to the Google Calendar feature (Similar to STAR)</li>
  <li>Social aspect: add a folder under an event for people to share pictures of them attending</li>
</ul>
