# New Rules

If there's one thing that I learned so far in my technical career it's that technology is always changing, the rules are always changing. Although most people might think that this is a given since we are working towards becoming technical innovators in the workspace of innovation, creativity, and new creations. I have grown to accept that this future career is learning to be comfortable with being uncomfortable, which is something that I am still working towards myself. With each new language, new Integrated Development Environment's (IDE), new syntax, new coding styles, etc. It makes me think: "Well what do I actually know?". I could go on to list all of the language's that I have ranges of experience in, but if I took a look into what I actually know is not a lot in retrospect. This leads me to my first goal of what I want to learn in the realm of software engineering, the first thing I want to learn and eventually master is the ability to develop creative and effective solutions. I believe that this is the basis of every successful engineer, and this isn't only bound to software but the other specialties that require critical thinking and problem solving skills. Being able to analyze a problem, and create a solution is a foundational skill that I would like to develop more and more into my technical career.

## Game Development

One of my personal goals is to become a game developer at some capacity. I've been surrounded by video games, card games, board games, etc. my entire life, so I'd like to translate the joy I have in programming into game development. Whenever I am playing a game I like to think in the eyes of the developer and team that created the reality that I was experiencing. I subconsciously think to myself things like: "Why did they choose to place this here?", "What advantages does this character have in this map?", "What were they thinking making this level so hard?", etc. In the light of what I'd like to learn is the languages and qualities required to become a game developer. 

## What happens now?

There is certainly no feeling like the fear of what is going to happen in the foreseeable future after college. The easy part of college is saying your name, major, hobbies, and an interesting fact. However the part that everyone fears is what comes the moment after we throw our caps in celebration of our long awaited graduation. Dipping my toe into the ocean for the first time is extremely terrifying, especially if you don't know how to swim. But if you were to have someone who knew how to swim there with you, or even a life vest to keep yourself afloat then this becomes a lot easier. These "helpers" in the beginning of our technical careers are exemplified in the forms of internships and networking. These are the two things that I'd like to learn how to apply or experience prior to graduating college in order to help me get my career in the tech industry kick started.
