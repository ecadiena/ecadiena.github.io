# HIDOE Legistracker
In collaboration with the Hawaii Department of Education, this project aims to modernize their current system which is run on LotusNotes and replace it with a modern and user friendly web application.

## The Solution
Our solution is to make a tracker that encompasses the required “Key Components” outlined in the sections of the home page. For example, we will add these features to: Add, Remove, and Store bills, the ability to sort the viewed bills by preference of user, and have notifications sent out via email that the user has signed up with. A potential feature to be suggested is a new in-client mailbox/notification system. The New LTS will increase the clarity and legibility of the previous system by eliminating unnecessary clutter and allow for easier navigation of the web page to the user. Overall our solution and or goal is to enable HIDOE to track legislation and set up workflow processes more efficiently and accurately than before.

## Responsibilities
I was one of the full stack developers on this team where I revamped template code and modified the previous database schemas to fit the data needs of the client. I also implemented conditional rendering of parts of the application that required elevated roles and were only visible to those through role based action control. Along with these responsibilities, I led project management by monitoring and distributing tasks to the team through GitHub's project boards.
